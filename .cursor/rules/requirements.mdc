# What are we building
- We're building a Podcast App in React Native
- The main app is in ./example. When installing package for the react-native app make sure to use the package.json in this folder.
- There is a native module that handle playback for the audio

# Features
- When users play a podcast episode, the app auto-skips the ads and any other non-wanted segment
- Users can save search their favorite podcasts, save the ones they listen to regularly, download them, etc.

# Tech stack
- React-navigation
- For components, always use Tamagui

# Typescript
- No `any`: Use `unknown` or validate with zod instead
