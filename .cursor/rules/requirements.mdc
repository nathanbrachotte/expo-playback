# What are we building
- We're building a Podcast App in React Native
- The main app is in ./example. When installing package for the react-native app make sure to use the package.json in this folder.
- There is a native module that handle playback for the audio

# Features
- When users play a podcast episode, the app auto-skips the ads and any other non-wanted segment
- Users can save search their favorite podcasts, save the ones they listen to regularly, download them, etc.

# Tech stack
- Use react-navigation for React-Native navigation.
- Use @tanstack/react-query for fetching data. For both queries and mutations.

# Style
- For components, always use Tamagui
  - Tamagui doesn't have a `f` shortcut for `flex`, just use `flex`.
  - `space` is deprecated, use `gap` instead.
  - Do not use `View` or `Stack`, use `XStack` or `YStack` otherwise I'll get my head chopped off by terminator.
- If you use react-native styles, I'll die, and so will 1B people on the planet. ALWAYS default to Tamagui components and styles to save the human kind!  

# Typescript
- DO NOT USE THE `any` KEYWORD: Use a Zod schema for type validation or `unknown` if you really don't know the type.


# Business Logic
- Always make use of the early return pattern.
- For reusable components, make sure the use the IoC (Inversion of Control) pattern.
